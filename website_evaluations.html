            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple Website</a></h3>
            <p>The official Apple website showcases its range of products, services, and innovations in a modern, visually appealing design.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses high contrast between text and background, making content stand out clearly.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, colors, and layout are consistent, reinforcing the brand's identity and providing a unified experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are neatly aligned, ensuring a clean and organized appearance that guides the user's eye naturally.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related items are grouped together, and there is ample space between distinct sections, making it easy to navigate.</li>

            <h3><a href="http://arngren.net" target="_blank">Arngren Website</a></h3>
            <p>Arngren is a Norwegian e-commerce site offering a variety of gadgets, but its design is cluttered and overwhelming, leading to a poor user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site lacks sufficient contrast, with text blending into the chaotic background, making it hard to focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There's no cohesive repetition of fonts, colors, or layout, resulting in a jumbled and inconsistent visual experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The layout lacks clear alignment, with elements placed randomly, causing confusion and difficulty in navigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated items are placed too close together, making it difficult to distinguish between different sections and products.</li>
            </ul>
